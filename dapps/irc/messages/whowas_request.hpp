		/// Whowas asks for information about a nickname which no longer exists.
		/// This may either be due to a nickname change or the user leaving IRC.
		/// In response to this query, the server searches through its nickname
		/// history, looking for any nicks which are lexically the same(no wild
		/// card matching here).The history is searched backward, returning the
		/// most recent entry first.If there are multiple entries, up to
		/// <count> replies will be returned(or all of them if no <count>
		/// parameter is given).If a non - positive number is passed as being
		/// <count>, then a full search is done.

		/// Wildcards are allowed in the <target> parameter.
