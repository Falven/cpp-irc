		/// Parameters: [<target>]
		///
		/// TRACE command is used to find the route to specific server and
		/// information about its peers.Each server that processes this command
		/// MUST report to the sender about it.The replies from pass - through
		/// links form a chain, which shows route to destination.After sending
		/// this reply back, the query MUST be sent to the next server until
		/// given <target> server is reached.
		///
		/// TRACE command is used to find the route to specific server.Each
		/// server that processes this message MUST tell the sender about it by
		/// sending a reply indicating it is a pass - through link, forming a chain
		/// of replies.After sending this reply back, it MUST then send the
		/// TRACE message to the next server until given server is reached.If
		/// the <target> parameter is omitted, it is RECOMMENDED that TRACE
		/// command sends a message to the sender telling which servers the local
		/// server has direct connection to.
		///
		/// If the destination given by <target> is an actual server, the
		/// destination server is REQUIRED to report all servers, services and
		/// operators which are connected to it; if the command was issued by an
		/// operator, the server MAY also report all users which are connected to
		/// it.If the destination given by <target> is a nickname, then only a
		/// reply for that nickname is given.If the <target> parameter is
		/// omitted, it is RECOMMENDED that the TRACE command is parsed as
		/// targeted to the processing server.
		///
		/// Wildcards are allowed in the <target> parameter.
		///
		/// Numeric Replies:
		/// ERR_NOSUCHSERVER
		///
		/// If the TRACE message is destined for another server, all
		/// intermediate servers must return a RPL_TRACELINK reply to indicate
		/// that the TRACE passed through it and where it is going next.
		///
		/// RPL_TRACELINK
		///
		/// A TRACE reply may be composed of any number of the following
		/// numeric replies.
		///
		/// RPL_TRACECONNECTING RPL_TRACEHANDSHAKE
		/// RPL_TRACEUNKNOWN    RPL_TRACEOPERATOR
		/// RPL_TRACEUSER       RPL_TRACESERVER
		/// RPL_TRACESERVICE    RPL_TRACENEWTYPE
