		/// The WALLOPS command is used to send a message to all currently
		/// connected users who have set the 'w' user mode for themselves.  (See
		/// Section 3.1.5 "User modes").
		///
		/// After implementing WALLOPS as a user command it was found that it was
		/// often and commonly abused as a means of sending a message to a lot of
		/// people.Due to this, it is RECOMMENDED that the implementation of
		/// WALLOPS allows and recognizes only servers as the originators of
		/// WALLOPS.

		/// Numeric Replies:
		/// ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS

		/// Example:
		/// : csd.bu.edu WALLOPS : Connect '*.uiuc.edu 6667' from Joshua
		/// ; WALLOPS message from csd.bu.edu announcing a
		/// CONNECT message it received from Joshua and acted upon.
