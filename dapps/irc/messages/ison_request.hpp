		/// Command: ISON
		/// Parameters: <nickname> *(SPACE <nickname>)
		///
		/// The ISON command was implemented to provide a quick and efficient
		/// means to get a response about whether a given nickname was currently
		/// on IRC.ISON only takes one(1) type of parameter : a space - separated
		/// list of nicks.For each nickname in the list that is present, the
		///
		/// server adds that to its reply string.Thus the reply string may
		/// return empty(none of the given nicks are present), an exact copy of
		/// the parameter string(all of them present) or any other subset of the
		/// set of nicks given in the parameter.The only limit on the number of
		/// nicks that may be checked is that the combined length MUST NOT be too
		/// large as to cause the server to chop it off so it fits in 512
		/// characters.
		///
		/// ISON is only processed by the server local to the client sending the
		/// command and thus not passed onto other servers for further
		/// processing.
		///
		/// Numeric Replies:
		/// RPL_ISON    ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS
		///
		/// Example:
		/// ISON phone trillian WiZ jarlek Avalon Angel Monstah syrk
		/// ; Sample ISON request for 7 nicks.
